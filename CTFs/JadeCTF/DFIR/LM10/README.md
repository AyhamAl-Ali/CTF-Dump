### Solution

The .pcapng file shows packets sent/received when someone was connecting to a website, that website seems to have 3 images and 1 flag.txt file but that flag.txt is just a wrick roll youtube link

- Searching thru the packets I found nothing so I tried to extract the images from the packets (Since I am new to Wireshark stuff I did some search and found that I can actually do that!)

- After extractign the images on of the images had the flag on the image!
