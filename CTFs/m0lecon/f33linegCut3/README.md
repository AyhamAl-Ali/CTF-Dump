### Question

> Hi everyone, I can't seem to reach my drug dea... I mean, my "product supplier". Anyway, here's a selfie, felt cute, might delete later. It's just a picture, don't bother with it, you won't find anything anyway.

### Solution

> First things first!

- I like to use [Aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com) (suggested by my great friend *Mimoza69 (Miar)*) - this website is AMAZING! it shows many useful info including how many times it was uploaded to their system!! others have uploaded this and it has a common password already revealed (tho I didn't look at that and tried to find it myself as you can see down below)
- Uploading the image to ther website and searching the results I reached a useful info at `String` section and found some weird **binaries**!
  - `b010101000110100001100101010011010110100101100111011010000111010001111001010100000110000101110111`
- Using [dcode.fr - ASCII code](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code) I found the password!
  - Password: `TheMightyPaw`
- Then!! went to `steghide` section in Aperisolve and found a ZIP file!! download it!!
- You will find a flag file!!! of course password protected BUT! we found the password already! `TheMightyPaw`
- Open the flag.txt file and VOILAAAA!!!
- You'll see the flag
